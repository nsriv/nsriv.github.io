In my free time, I like to read (taking baby steps into fiction after years of strictly nonfiction), watch soccer and Formula 1, and take photos of the world around me.

I'm a passionate believer in the world being better off for having more generalists. There are many devoted to pushing the world forward, but I'm focused on making sure the rewards from the front make it to the back of the line.

To that end, I'm transitioning from a career as an educator to analytical roles that center human potential and incorporate my disparate interests in politics, public advocacy, technology, impact litigation, and development economics.

Currently, I'm actively looking for new opportunities as a Data Analyst.

Always happy to talk! Feel free to reach out @nsriv on any major socials, or contact me through the site.
